                              If set to 1 (default), convert to
                              -outgrayprofile if specified (pass-through if
                              unspecified).
                         add: -outRGBgrayprofile to allow special handling

                              CMYK images. If set to 0, pass-through CMYK
                              images. Default is 1 (convert CMYK images if
                              -outprofile is specified)
